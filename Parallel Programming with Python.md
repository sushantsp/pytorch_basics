### Sequential vs. Parallel Computing
This chapter introduces the concept of sequential and parallel computing, using the analogy of cooking a salad. Here's a summary of the main points:
Topic	Summary
| Topic| Summary|
| :---------------- | :------: |
|Sequential Computing       |   Described as a single cook making a salad, this is a traditional method of programming where tasks are executed one after another. It's easy to understand but has limitations in terms of speed and efficiency.| 
| Parallel Computing          |   Compared to having multiple cooks preparing the salad together, this method breaks down tasks into independent parts that can be executed simultaneously. This increases the overall throughput of a program and allows for large tasks to be accomplished faster.|
| Challenges in Parallel Computing   |  The challenges include the need for coordination and communication between different "processors" (the cooks), and potential waiting times if one task depends on the completion of another.| 
	
 * Sequential computing is like a single cook preparing a salad, executing tasks one after another.
 * Parallel computing is like multiple cooks preparing the salad together, executing tasks simultaneously.
 * Parallel computing can increase the overall throughput of a program, allowing for larger tasks to be accomplished faster.

The challenges of parallel computing include the need for coordination and communication between tasks, and potential waiting times for dependent tasks.
